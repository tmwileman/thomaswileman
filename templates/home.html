        I am Thomas Wileman, a Senior Data Scientist at Red Hat. I've found that thoughtfully recording the significant
        points of study topics helps me to process the material. This is especially true if I take the time to think
        about simplifying concepts in a way that is accessible to a five year old. This site serves as a repository
        for my technical and ELI5 notes on data science topics ranging from Python, machine learning, statistics, and
        much more.
